## Project Description
This project is to simplify the data that comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. See the following link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. Per user, each activity and measurement should get an average measurement for output.

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
From above link, 
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 


##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
To create the tidy data file, run the `main.R` R file. This will download the raw data, unzip, merge, and then tidy it up. 

###Cleaning of the data
The data is cleaned by 

1. Reading both the training, and the test data sets
1. Adding the user who took those measurements to each row
1. Add the activity the user was performing to each row
1. These data sets are then merged
1. All columns apart from Mean, Standard Deviation, Label (activity type), and Subject
1. The data is aggregated by the Subject, and the type of activity that was occuring
1. The aggregate data is aggregated over the mean function
1. This resul is written to `output.csv`

## Attribute Data
The signals from the link above were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
